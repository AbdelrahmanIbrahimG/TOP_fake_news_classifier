# TOP (Fake News Classifier)

**Cut Through the Noise. Get the Real Story with TOP**

In today's digital age, misinformation spreads like wildfire. To combat this challenge, we've developed the **TOP** project. A comprehensive solution that combines cutting-edge AI, APIs, and user-friendly interfaces.

 Before we begin. Check out the workflow architecture of how TOP works:

## The Core AI Model

At the heart of TOP lies a powerful AI model. Deployed in a public cloud environment, it ensures scalability and accessibility. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Processing**: Our model processes vast amounts of data, continuously learning to identify new patterns of deception within news articles.
2. **NLP Techniques**: We employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze writing styles and vocabulary usage.
3. **TF-IDF Analysis**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) helps us understand the importance of words in each article.
4. **Decision Tree Model**: By training our data using a decision tree machine learning model, we achieve an impressive accuracy of 88%.

## Empowering developers with TOP API

We believe in empowering users to actively combat misinformation. That's why we offer the **TOP API**:

- **Cloud-Based Restful API**: Developed using FastAPI and hosted on the KOYEB platform, the TOP API acts as a bridge for integration with various applications.
- **Fact-Checking Features**: Developers can seamlessly integrate our API into existing platforms, allowing users to verify information effortlessly.
